Welcome to the **DSA LeetCode Roadmap** repository!  
This repo is designed to help you systematically learn and master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through curated practice on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). It serves as both a roadmap and a collection of resources, code solutions, and references to help you prepare for coding interviews and strengthen your problem-solving skills.

## 🚀 Overview

- **Focus:** DSA concepts and LeetCode practice.
- **Languages:**  
  - JavaScript (50.3%)
  - CSS (41.5%)
  - HTML (8.2%)
- **Goal:** To provide a structured, step-by-step journey to crack DSA topics commonly asked in interviews.
